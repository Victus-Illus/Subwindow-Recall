	<h1>Subwindow Recall</h1>
	<p>A plugin that recalls subwindows layout</p>
	<h2>What does it do?</h2>
	<p>Subwindow Recall saves the sizes and positions of subwindows in a file, which is then able
   	to read that file to recall them, so that it can reproduce the layout of the subwindows previously set by the user.</p>
    
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>To use Subwindow Recall all you need to do is enable 'Save Subwindow Layout' in Tools/Scripts, that will make so that the plugin starts creating save files of the subwindows layout every time you save. Then, when you want to recall the layout, use the 'Load Subwindow Layout' in Tools/Scripts</p>
	<p>Shortcuts can be added for both actions.</p>

	<h3>Tips</h3>
 	<ul>
		<li>It is recommended setting a shortcut for 'Load Subwindow Layout', as it is the one you will be using the most.</li>
		<li>This plugin works best in conjunction with Krita Sessions, which can be acessed by File -> Sessions</li>
		<li>You are able to reuse layouts in different works, all you have to do is copy the .txt file of the layout you wish to reuse, and then paste it in the same folder/directory as the .kra file, be sure to give it the same name as that file (drawing_2.kra -> drawing_2.txt)
		<li>A backup file of the current layout is always created whenever you save, with the extension .txt~, to re-activate it, all you have to do is remove the ~</li> 
	</ul>
